Types:
Primitives:
1. Qubit (qubit)
  Defined as 1 quantum bit. Can be initialised ([state]) to 1, 0, true, false, or into a quantum state defined by a 2*1 matrix, its 1*2 transpose, or a string representation*.
  Syntax:
  x = qubit([state])
  or
  x = qubit()  (defaults to state |0>)

2. C-bit (cbit)
  Defined as 1 classical bit. Can be initialised ([value]) to 1, 0, true, or false.
  Syntax:
  x = bit([value])
  or
  x = bit() (defaults to 0/false)
  or
  x = true/false

3. Q-num (qnum)
  Defined as an number represented by a register of qubits. Can be initialised into a state defined by a n*1 matrix, its 1*n transpose, or a string representation*.
  Numbers are encoded and stored in binary in the computational basis either with floating point or 2's complement.
  Syntax:
  x = qnum([value])
  x = qnum(5)
  or
  x = qnum(5.123)
  or
  x = qnum([state])

4. Phase-encoded Q-num (qnump)
  Defined as an number represented by a register of qubits. Can be initialised into a state defined by a n*1 matrix, its 1*n transpose, or a string representation*.
  Numbers are encoded and stored in the phase elemenet of the register using Quantum Fourier Transform.
  Syntax:
  x = qnump([value])
  x = qnump(5)
  or
  x = qnump(5.123)
  or
  x = qnump([state])


5. C-num (cnum)
  Defined as a number represented by a register of classical bits. Can be initialised to a number.
  Syntax:
  x = cnum(5)
  or
  x = 5
  or
  x = cnum(5.5)
  or
  x = 5.5

6. Q-string (qstr)
  Defined as a string represented by a register of qubits. Can be initialised to a string of characters.
  Strings are encoded using ASCII. Each character requires 7 qubits.
  Syntax:
  x = qstr("")

7. Shortend Q-string (qstrs)
  Defined as a string represented by a register of qubits. Can be initialised to a string of characters.
  Strings are encoded using a non-alphanumeric version of ITA2. Each character requires 5 qubits.
  Syntax:
  x = qstrs("")

8. Shortend Cyrillic Q-string (qstrc)
  Defined as a string represented by a register of qubits. Can be initialised to a string of characters.
  Strings are encoded using a non-alphanumeric version of MTK2. Each character requires 5 qubits.
  Syntax:
  x = qstrc("")

9. Extended Q-string (qstre)
  Defined as a string represented by a register of qubits. Can be initialised to a string of characters.
  Strings are encoded using UTF-8. Each character requires 8-32 qubits.
  Syntax:
  x = qstre("")

10. C-string (cstr)
  Defined as a string represented by a register of classical bits. Can be initialised to a string of characters.
  Strings are encoded using ASCII. Each character requires 7 bits.
  Syntax:
  x = cstr("")
  or
  x = ""

11. Shortend C-string (cstrs)
  Defined as a string represented by a register of classical bits. Can be initialised to a string of characters.
  Strings are encoded using a non-alphanumeric version of ITA2. Each character requires 5 bits.
  Syntax:
  x = cstrs("")

12. Shortend Cyrillic C-string (cstrc)
  Defined as a string represented by a register of classical bits. Can be initialised to a string of characters.
  Strings are encoded using a non-alphanumeric version of MTK2. Each character requires 5 bits.
  Syntax:
  x = cstrc("")
  or
  x = "[Compatible string containing characters not compatible with ASCII]"

13. Extended C-string (cstre)
  Defined as a string represented by a register of classical bits. Can be initialised to a string of characters.
  Strings are encoded using UTF-8. Each character requires between 8-32 bits.
  Syntax:
  x = cstre("")
  or
  x = "[Compatible string containing characters not compatible with ASCII or MTK2]"

Data Structures:
1. List (list)
  Defined as an ordered collection of primatives, references, or data structures. Can be initialised with type arguements or list members.
  Syntax:
  x = list("type", [comma-separated list of types])      eg. x = list("type",[cnum,cstr,set,matrix])  Note: "type" must be a cstr containing "type"
  or
  x = list([comma-separated list of members])            eg. x = list([x,y,"cat",5])
